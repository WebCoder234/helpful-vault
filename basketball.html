            <h2>Lesson 2: Rules of Basketball</h2>
            <div class="estimate">Estimated Read Time: 6 minutes</div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Understanding the rules of basketball is vital for both players and spectators. Knowledge of the game’s regulations ensures fair play and fosters respect among players. In this lesson, we will dive into essential rules and concepts, including how the game is structured, violations, fouls, and game flow.</p>
                <p><strong>1. Game Structure:</strong> A standard basketball game consists of four quarters, each lasting 12 minutes in professional leagues (10 minutes in FIBA). A team scores points by shooting the ball through the opponent's hoop. When the game is tied at the end of regulation, overtime periods are played.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Scoring:</strong> Different types of baskets yield varying scores:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Field goals made inside the three-point arc: 2 points.</li>
                    <li>Field goals made beyond the three-point arc: 3 points.</li>
                    <li>Free throws: 1 point each.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>3. Violations:</strong> There are several key violations that can result in a loss of possession:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Traveling:</strong> Taking too many steps without dribbling.</li>
                    <li><strong>Double Dribble:</strong> Dribbling the ball, stopping, and then starting again.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shot Clock Violation:</strong> Failing to attempt a shot before the 24-second shot clock expires.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>4. Fouls:</strong> Fouls are typically categorized as personal fouls and technical fouls:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal fouls occur when a player makes illegal physical contact with an opponent, leading to free throws.</li>
                    <li>Technical fouls are not related to physical play, such as unsportsmanlike conduct or violations by a coach.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Players must also be mindful of the number of fouls they commit, as personal fouls can lead to disqualification depending on the league's rules. Understanding these guidelines ensures smooth gameplay and helps players avoid unnecessary penalties.</p>
                <p>Through mastering these regulations, you will gain the confidence to participate in games while also fostering professional behavior on the court.</p>

            <h2>Lesson 3: Player Positions and Responsibilities</h2>
            <div class="estimate">Estimated Read Time: 7 minutes</div>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Basketball teams consist of five players on the court, each with specific positions and roles. Understanding these positions helps players recognize their responsibilities while also appreciating the contributions from teammates. In this lesson, we will explore the five primary positions: point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center.</p>
                <p><strong>1. Point Guard (PG):</strong> Often termed the "floor general," the point guard is responsible for orchestrating plays and has a keen understanding of the game. Prime tasks include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dribbling the ball up the court.</li>
                    <li>Setting up team plays and distributing the ball effectively.</li>
                    <li>Defending against opposing guards.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>2. Shooting Guard (SG):</strong> Typically known for being the primary scorer, the shooting guard possesses strong shooting skills and an agile offense. Responsibilities include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Shooting from long-distance (three-point shots).</li>
                    <li>Driving to the basket for scores.</li>
                    <li>Playing solid perimeter defense.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>3. Small Forward (SF):</strong> A versatile player, the small forward combines the offensive strength of the shooting guard with the defensive and rebounding abilities of the power forward. Key tasks include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scoring from various areas on the floor.</li>
                    <li>Rebounding and playing perimeter defense.</li>
                    <li>Transitioning quickly between offense and defense.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>4. Power Forward (PF):</strong> The power forward plays a critical role in scoring and rebounding close to the basket. Often referred to as a "post player," responsibilities include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Defending against opposing big men.</li>
                    <li>Scoring in the post or mid-range areas.</li>
                    <li>Rebounding after missed shots.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>5. Center (C):</strong> Typically the tallest player on the team, the center occupies the key area near the basket, and their roles emphasize:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Blocking shots and protecting the rim.</li>
                    <li>Scoring from close range and executing effective post moves.</li>
                    <li>Gathering rebounds and initiating fast breaks.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Recognizing the different player roles allows team members to work cohesively, maximizing overall effectiveness on both offense and defense. By appreciating the strengths of each position, players can better execute their game plans.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>In-and-Out Dribble:</strong> A move that deceives defenders by faking a drive in one direction before quickly moving in the opposite direction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spin Move:</strong> A complete rotation while maintaining control of the ball to evade an opponent.</li>
                    <li><strong>Step-Back Dribble:</strong> Creating space for a jump shot by stepping back quickly while dribbling.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li><strong>Layup:</strong> A close-range shot taken on the move, often executed with one hand when approaching the basket.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dunk:</strong> A powerful shot where the player jumps and scores directly through the hoop.</li>
                    <li><strong>Free Throw:</strong> An unopposed shot from the free-throw line awarded after fouls, worth one point.</li>
                </ul>
