            <h2>Earthquakes</h2>
            <p>Earthquakes can happen without warning, making it essential to be prepared. First, you should create an emergency kit filled with water, non-perishable food, a flashlight, batteries, a first-aid kit, and any necessary medications. Keep this kit in a place that is easily accessible so you can grab it quickly during an emergency.</p>
            <p>During the shaking, remember to follow the â€˜Drop, Cover, and Hold Onâ€™ technique. Get down on your hands and knees to prevent being knocked over, cover your head and neck under sturdy furniture or against an interior wall, and hold on until the shaking stops. This reduces the chance of injury from falling debris.</p>
            <p>If you are indoors, stay inside, as moving outside during shaking can expose you to falling objects. If you are in bed, cover your head with a pillow. After the shaking stops, check for injuries and damage before evacuating if necessary.</p>
            <p>Outside, find an open area away from buildings, trees, streetlights, and utility wires. Once the shaking has stopped, remain aware of potential aftershocks, which often follow the main quake.</p>
            <p>Finally, keep in touch with family and loved ones through emergency communication plans. Know how to communicate your status and location, as mobile signals may be disrupted. Understanding your local emergency procedures and evacuation routes is crucial for safety and preparedness.</p>

        <section id="volcano" class="content-section">
            <h2>Volcanic Eruptions</h2>
            <p>When living near a volcano, your first step should be to understand the alert levels (normal, advisory, watch, warning) set by authorities. Stay informed through local news and geological surveys about any changes in volcanic activity. Preparation includes creating an emergency kit with essentials for evacuation.</p>
            <p>If an eruption is imminent, evacuate immediately if instructed by authorities. To protect yourself from ash fall, wear masks, goggles, and long-sleeved clothing. Keeping windows and doors closed can help prevent ash from entering your home.</p>
            <p>When ash falls, avoid driving unless absolutely necessary. Ash can severely reduce visibility and make roads slippery. If driving is unavoidable, keep your headlights on and drive slowly, maintaining a safe distance from other vehicles.</p>
            <p>Post-eruption, stay indoors until local authorities declare it safe. Monitor air quality reports to avoid ash inhalation, and clean up ash carefully, using proper protective equipment to prevent respiratory problems.</p>
            <p>Finally, communicate regularly with family and friends during a volcanic eruption, keeping them informed about your safety. Creating a family emergency plan and regularly practicing it can help reduce panic and confusion during an actual event.</p>

        <section id="tsunami" class="content-section">
            <h2>Tsunamis</h2>
            <p>Tsunamis are often preceded by an earthquake. Familiarize yourself with the local tsunami evacuation routes before a disaster strikes. Your home should have a disaster kit ready, including water, food, a flashlight, a whistle, and essential medications that could sustain you for several days.</p>
            <p>When a tsunami warning is issued, it is critical to move to higher ground immediately. Do not wait for further instructions, as the first wave may not be the largest. If you are in a coastal area and feel an earthquake, head for higher ground or inland as soon as it is safe to do so.</p>
            <p>If you are in a boat, stay away from harbors and shallow waters if a tsunami is approaching, as they can create unpredictable waves. Instead, head to open waters and listen for instructions from authorities.</p>
            <p>After the tsunami, avoid returning to the coastline until declared safe by authorities. Follow emergency broadcasts for information on health advisories, possible contamination, and other dangers to be aware of.</p>
            <p>In terms of longer-term planning, participating in local disaster preparedness drills and education programs can improve your tsunami response. Establishing communication plans with family members can also ensure everyone knows what to do in an emergency.</p>

            <h2>Landslides</h2>
            <p>Preparing for landslides involves identifying whether you live in a landslide-prone area. Check with local geological surveys about risks and take steps to manage drainage around your property, such as creating drainage ditches and ensuring proper erosion control.</p>
            <p>Have an emergency kit ready that includes water, snacks, a flashlight, and a first aid kit. Be aware of your local evacuation routes and what to do during heavy rainfall.</p>
            <p>If you notice signs of a landslide, such as cracks in the ground or bulging earth, evacuate immediately to higher ground. Avoid walking through elevated debris or over unstable ground.</p>
            <p>After a landslide, stay clear of the affected area and listen to local warnings. Be aware of the possibility of aftershocks or further slides in areas affected by heavy rains.</p>
            <p>Stay informed about weather conditions and report any concerns to local authorities. Communicate with family to ensure everyone is aware of safety protocols.</p>

            <h2>Avalanches</h2>
            <p>Preparation for avalanches starts with understanding the areas you spend time in. While enjoying winter sports, remain informed of avalanche risks and check local avalanche forecasts. Always choose routes with a lower risk of slides.</p>
            <p>Your emergency kit should include essentials like water, food, first-aid supplies, and an avalanche transceiver if you are venturing into backcountry areas. Additionally, carry a shovel, a probe, and safety equipment like helmets and goggles.</p>
            <p>In case of an avalanche, if youâ€™re caught, try to move to the side of the slide to avoid being buried completely. Swimming actions will help keep you from getting pulled down. When the slide stops, create an air pocket in front of your mouth and nose as you settle. Stay calm and still.</p>
            <p>Post-avalanche, be aware of secondary avalanches and continue to seek higher ground. Monitor weather conditions and follow local emergency protocols for rescuing or recovering others.</p>
            <p>Communicate with authorities and stay connected with search and rescue teams during recovery efforts. Understanding community resources available after an avalanche can aid recovery efforts.</p>
